<h1>Coaching to Advanced ScrumMaster and beyond</h1>

<h2>Executive Summary:</h2>

<p>This site describes a coaching based program facilitating individuals to advance through the entire Advanced ScrumMaster, Advanced Product Owner, CSP-SM, or CSP-PO curriculums and beyond. The program is competency based, so learning objectives where the individual can already demonstrate competency can be bypassed. The remaining learning objectives become a Product Backlog that is ordered and completed as a co-creative collaboration between the individual and the coach. Like the learning objectives, the means of achieving competencies are not prescriptive. Since the program is delivered using a coaching-centric approach it can be tailored to each individual, allowing a broad range of activities to be used to demonstrate the required level of competency. The result is an individual focused, flexible, meaningful development program. </p>

<p>Finally the program is designed to not only provide a pathway of continuing development within the Scrum Alliance certification system, but also to create a viral, virtuous development cycle that propagates the program, adding value to the coaching certifications while working with individuals to make a significant contribution in “changing the world of work.”</p>

<h2>A Scrum-like approach</h2>

<p>The general structure of the program adopts a Scrum-like paradigm, following a <em>learn by doing</em> or <em>use the thing to teach the thing</em> approach.</p>

<p>The following sections describe the approach in terms of Scrum framework elements.</p>

<h3>The roles</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> The Scrum Alliance has provided the Product Backlog in terms of learning objectives. They also credential candidates who satisfy certification requirements.</li>
<li><strong>ScrumMaster:</strong> As a coach, mentor, consultant, and trainer the ScrumMaster works with individuals, and teams, as appropriate, to identify their unique learning path.</li>
<li><strong>Development Team:</strong> In this case usually a cross-functional, self-organizing, team of one; the individual is responsible for working with the coach to assess their current status, identify goals, establish plans for meeting those goals, order the backlog according to these goals, and progress against their forecast on an incremental basis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The artifacts:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong> The Scrum Alliance has provided the Product Backlog in the form of learning objectives. The Product Backlog items use certain terms to identify the capability expected to demonstrate competence at the level required for certification. Since this program uses a competency based model, PBIs where the candidate can demonstrate that the expected level of competence has already been achieved can be immediately marked as Done.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong> The Development Team will order the Product Backlog, with support from the ScrumMaster (coach) as required. The Development Team will also decide how they will accomplish their work. This flexibility allows them to demonstrate competency in a variety of ways tailored to their own learning preference (for example different individuals may use a visual model, a written case study, or a documented dialog with the coach to demonstrate competency).</li>
<li><strong>Increment:</strong> Each iteration the Development Team are expected to complete the PBIs they have selected for the Sprint; demonstrating the appropriate level of competence for each PBI.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The activities:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sprint:</strong> The Development Team, working in conjunction with the Scrum Master, will determine Sprint duration. Consistent with Scrum maximum Sprint duration is one month (with a preference for shorter duration Sprints).</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> At the beginning of each Sprint the Development Team will work, in collaboration with the ScrumMaster, to identify the PBIs (learning objectives, of, if required, a functional subset of a learning objective) that they will complete during the Sprint as well as the acceptance criteria that will allow validation that the PBI has been completed.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Scrum:</strong> The Development Team will be encouraged to have a mindful daily practice of reflecting on their progress, taking necessary steps to inspect, adapt, and assure transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> At the end of the Sprint, or at the option of the Development Team and the ScrumMaster more frequently, PBIs that have been completed will be inspected and those that meet the acceptance criteria will be identified as Done.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong> The Development Team and the ScrumMaster will conduct a Retrospective at the end of each Sprint to determine how they can continue to improve to become even more effective in subsequent Sprints.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The values:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Scrum values: <strong>courage, commitment, openness, focus, and respect</strong> will be applied throughout the relationship. Professional coaching standards including a non-judgement and an environment of mutual trust will be applied. A working agreement specifying a commitment to respect these values, along with any other values or principles that the Development Team and ScrumMaster want to put in place, will be defined at the beginning of the relationship.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The approach</h2>

<p>The Development Team (individual or group) will hire the ScrumMaster (coach) and co-develop a working agreement that will specify terms for the relationship. The working agreement can be as formal or informal as desired. The working agreement should specify when and how activities should be performed. The structure of the program allows for either virtual or in-person delivery, but synchronous communication for all activities other than the Daily Scrum are a required component to the program. </p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>For both the Development Team (client) and ScrumMaster (coach) it’s important to understand the current status (reality, in the GROW model). For the Development Team this would likely include not only an understanding where they are at in terms of the learning objectives, but also awareness of their own learning preferences so that they can consider how to best achieve their learning goals. </p>

<p>This program proposes that one, or more if required, synchronous sessions (realtime virtual or face-to-face) to establish the current reality and high-level goals. To paraphrase Eisenhower, this is about planning, not <em>the</em> plan. The Development Team and ScrumMaster will inspect and adapt throughout the engagement as appropriate to ensure an effective learning experience.</p>

<h3>Tracking progress</h3>

<p>Tracking progress is essential to assure timely progress and the completion of PBIs. While this program is not intended to be prescriptive, and therefore some other approaches might be used, a possible set of structures that would be used to deliver this program include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scrum Board:</strong> A Scrum board can be set up in Trello, LeanKit, or another tool. The Product Backlog would be all learning objectives for the respective level. Through the assessment approach described above the Development Team and ScrumMaster would determine what competencies have already been met, moving those to Done, and then order the remaining items with the Development Team doing the primary ordering based on their own learning focus or what might be of most value based on their immediate need within their own work environment. During Sprint Planning the Development Team will pull things into the Sprint, understand and agree with the ScrumMaster on the acceptance criteria, and produce a plan for how they will accomplish their work. It is envisioned that often this work will be performed asynchronously, however it is also likely that consulting and mentoring might also be applied to bridge gaps as required. In all cases a mutually agreed upon, tangible outcome (increment) should be produced.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking spreadsheet:</strong> A spreadsheet that identifies all learning objectives, the date the learning objective was met, a reference to the tangible outcome (increment) produced, and confirmation by the ScrumMaster that the learning objective has been satisfied can be used to assure that all learning objectives have been met and can be used as a audit trail by the Scrum Alliance to validate satisfaction of the learning objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Development Team Portfolio:</strong> As the Development Team progresses through the program, the tangible outcomes (increment) they are producing can be assembled into a portfolio. Working with the ScrumMaster to identify and create meaningful increments as they are satisfying learning objectives is an important additional benefit of this coaching-centric approach. The portfolio can be stored on a cloud drive shared with the ScrumMaster (and potentially the Scrum Alliance for auditing purposes).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional program benefits</h2>

<p>An underlying hypothesis for this program is that for the advanced certifications to be valued they must also be valuable. By helping individuals not only develop deeper understanding of Scrum, but also having a tangible outcome in the portfolio they create additional value is created. Beyond this, however, the program itself is designed to become a self-sustaining value cycle. Individuals graduating from the program and progressing on to a Scrum Alliance coaching certification (including the CTC certification) can duplicate this program, free of charge, and deliver it as a for-profit service. By enabling coaches to make money from the service, it propagates marketing and “pull”. Marketing an pull, along with the possible outcome of developing ones own business will help drive additional demand. The result is a virtuous cycle that not only provides meaning and value to the path to CSP (and beyond, to CTC and CEC) certifications, but also to the coaching certifications themselves. </p>
