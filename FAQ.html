                        A coaching-based approach is a strong alternative to attending classroom based training. Unlike
                        classroom-based training, a coaching program can be tailored to individual preferences and
                        learning styles. It allows knowlege to be acquired over time, allowing deeper learning through
                        practice and reflection. It also allows the learner to work with topics as they become relevant
                        to their needs, further increasing learning effectiveness.

                        The time required to complete the programs vary depending on the individual. If you already have
                        extensive experiece as a ScrumMaster and can readily demonstrate the required levels of
                        competency you can progress through the program quickly. If you have just completed your
                        Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) training and have limited prior experience then it will take longer.
                        How quickly you progress is largely up to you. Keep in mind that this program is optimized for
                        depth and capability, not speed. <strong>Each program must be completed within one
